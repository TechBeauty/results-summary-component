## My process

I took the time to thoroughly examine the design specs for this challenge. Additionally, I used a mobile viewing app to assist me in achieving a responsive design.


### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I'm currently utilizing Codecademy to further my education. I believe it has significantly enhanced my skills in responsive web design. I am gaining a strong grasp of HTML and CSS, and I'm excited to expand my knowledge further in the field of web development.
